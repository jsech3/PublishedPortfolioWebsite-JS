# Welcome to My Blog!

This is an example blog post written in MDX. You can use all the power of Markdown plus React components!

## Why MDX is Amazing

1. Write content in Markdown
2. Use React components when needed
3. Best of both worlds!

```javascript
// You can even include code blocks!
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Adding Images

You can add images from your public folder or external sources:
